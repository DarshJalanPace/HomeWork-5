God of war ragnarok is the best game ever created. It is the perfect blend of high intensity balanced combat with one of the best story in any media. 
The game is further elevated by their unique style of semi-open game world. It combines the focus of linear games with the sense of exploration and wonder that an open world brings. 
God of ragnarok, on top of all that, also has the same one shot camera style of its predecessor, along with excellent direction and voice acting by thpose involved. The game it is to die for. 
Seriously, critise and I am shouting, "BLOOD FOR BLOOD GOD!!!!". jk
